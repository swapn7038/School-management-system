<h3>Atal Tinkering Labs</h3>

<p>With our vision to ‘Cultivate one Million children in India as Neoteric Innovators’, Atal Innovation Mission is establishing Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATLs) in schools across India. ATLs aim to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in students, and inculcate skills such as design perspective, computational thinking, adaptive learning, physical computing etc.

20 schools under the banner of Ryan Group have been shortlisted to set up ATLs in the school premises. The ATL representatives at Ryan Schools conduct different activities ranging from regional and national level competitions, exhibitions, workshops on problem solving, designing and fabrication of products, lecture series etc. at periodic intervals.

The Atal Tinkering Lab of Ryan International School, Greater Noida, is featured in the Limca Book of Records for participating in an e-waste awareness and collection drive, by collecting 245kg of e-waste, along with 15 other schools collecting a total of 3,107 kgs of e-waste. The event was organised by Grey Sim Ltd in collaboration with 15 Atal Tinkering Labs.</p>
